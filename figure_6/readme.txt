Files are included to generate the plots in Fig 6E. The three folders 
generate the data for the respectively labeled model phenotypes (i.e., WT, 
IL-10 KO, and TGFb KO). Each folder had two subfolders: "runSimulation" and 
"analyzeData". The former folder contains code to run the simulations 
through a unix shell. The latter folder contains Matlab code to analyze the
data and produce the panels from Fig 6E.

Note: Data in .bin files are unavailable on the ModelDB database, a complete package of code and data can be accessed here:
