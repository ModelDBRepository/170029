Files to run the model and generate the data in Fig 1:

1. runsim.m 	- run simulation with LPS = 1000 and plot cytokine waveforms
2. odefn.m 	- code for the ODE model
3. params.bin 	- model parameters
4. Fig1B.png 	- plots from main text Fig 1B; all such simulated data are plotted by runsim.m

Instructions


Open the MATLAB interface and enter:

	>> runsim
